# Overview
**Zombie** is a game engine I developed as a side project to enable future game development in C++. Up until now, I have been the sole contributor to the project. As my first venture into game engine development, it is not perfect, but it represents a significant learning experience and a foundation for further development and improvement.

## Development Details

This game engine has been developed exclusively on Linux and is not intended to be compatible with other operating systems. The project is written in `C++` and utilizes the `SDL2` library to manage graphics, input, and other multimedia functions. For building the project, a Makefile is used to streamline the compilation process. Additionally, the codebase is consistently formatted using `clang-format`, ensuring that the code adheres to a uniform style throughout the project.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To build and run this game engine, you will need to have the following installed on your system:

- `g++`
- `make`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone [[your-repo-url]](https://github.com/ilBuso/zombie.git)
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd zombie
   ```

3. Build the project using `make`:
   ```sh
   make
   ```

# Usage
For detailed information on how to get started with using and developing this game engine, please refer to the documentation. All necessary information can be found in the `doc` folder of the repository. The main documentation file is [DOCUMENTATION.md](./doc/DOCUMENTATION.md).

# Contributing
At this moment, I am not accepting contribution to the game engine. However, I appreciate your interest and contributions may be considered in the future.
